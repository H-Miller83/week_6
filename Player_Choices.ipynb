To help us do so, I ran a clustering model on the data of NBA players, which essentially grouped the players into similar categories. I then plotted the data with points on the x-axis and assists on the y-axis to show a general trend of performance that can guide our decisions. Generally, the higher performing players are in cluster 0 (the circles) while the lower performing players are in cluster 1 (squares). The plot is then colored by salary, which is crucial in our goal of obtaining underpaid players."
